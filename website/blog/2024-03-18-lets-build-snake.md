In this video tutorial, we'll build a version of the classic game 'Snake!', from scratch.

Snake is an excellent "Hello, world!" project to help you learn any game engine, but here we'll be using our very own, Indigo.

If you'd like to follow along, please take a look at our Giter8 template to get set up with a blank project:
