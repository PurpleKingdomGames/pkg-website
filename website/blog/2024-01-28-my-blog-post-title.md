It's 2024! Did you make any new years resolutions this year?

One of my resolutions in 2023 (yikes!) was to work up the nerve to do another meet up talk, since [the last one was in pre-pandemic, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmZETGZKCVU)!

I was able to internally justify putting off my plans for most of the year due to some employment turbulance. However towards the end of 2023, the wonderful [London Scala User Group (LSUG)](https://www.meetup.com/london-scala/) had signed me up as a speaker, albeit for January 2024. Nonetheless, as far as following through on new years resolutions go, I'm still calling that a win.

As far as I know the video hasn't emerged yet, but I'll post an update when it does. The [slides and demos from the Loveable Scala Rogues talk can be found in this repo](https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/talks).

It was a great night for showcasing Scala as a creative tool, the other speaker of the night was Paul Matthews producing music in Scala.js using our very own Tyrian web framework! It was a great talk, and Paul received a huge round of applause for his impromtu live Scala.js piano playing!

Hopefully 2024 will bring more examples of creative Scala.
