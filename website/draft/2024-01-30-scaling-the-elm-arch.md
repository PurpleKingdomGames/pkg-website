Both [Indigo](https://indigoengine.io/) and [Tyrian](https://tyrian.indigoengine.io/) follow a flavour of the frontend architecture design called 'The Elm Architecture', also known as the 'TEA' pattern.

In this post we're going to briefly intoduce the TEA pattern, talk about when and why it starts to break down as your application grows, and then show you how to scale beyond that point.

## The Elm Architecture (TEA)

The Elm architecture is an elegant frontend design pattern that was borne out of [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/). Elm's goal is to make frontend development fun and reliable; to give the programmer a lot of mechanical support, and (aim to) guarantee that if the program compiles, it works. A superb goal, and a far cry from the status quo of traditional dynamic frontend dev technologies.

To achieve this, Elm's author (Evan Czaplicki), devised a language and a application architecture based on statically typed functional programming principles.

Initially the architecture was based on ideas from [Functional Reactive Programming (FRP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming) - the 'go to' approach of functional programming for GUI's (Graphical User Interfaces) - but over time it moved away from FRP and became a distinct pattern all of its own.
