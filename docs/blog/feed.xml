<p>Indigo and Tyrian are both based on flavours of the Elm architecture; But why that architecture pattern, and how does it work?</p>
<p>In this post, we define some desired principles of how we'd like to program a Graphical User Interface (GUI), and watch the Elm architecture's API inevitably emerge.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/img/blog/lighting_layout.png" alt="'Hoplike', a little game I made for the 'Lovable Scala Rogues' talk."></p>
<p>It's 2024! Yes, I know we're well into Feburary by now... but did you make any new years resolutions?</p>
<p>One of my resolutions from <em>last</em> year, was to work up the nerve to do another Scala meet-up talk on <a href="https://indigoengine.io/">Indigo</a>. The last time I did one (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmZETGZKCVU"><strong>'Functional Game Programming'</strong></a>) was in the heady days of pre-pandemic 2020, and a lot has happened since then, both in terms of Indigo's development, and the Scala community in general.</p>
