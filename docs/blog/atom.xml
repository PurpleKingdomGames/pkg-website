<p>It's 2024! Yes, I know we're well into Feburary by now... but did you make any new years resolutions?</p>
<p>One of my resolutions from <em>last</em> year, was to work up the nerve to do another Scala meet-up talk on <a href="https://indigoengine.io/">Indigo</a>. The last time I did one (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmZETGZKCVU"><strong>'Functional Game Programming'</strong></a>) was in the heady days of pre-pandemic 2020, and a lot has happened since then, both in terms of Indigo's development, and the Scala community in general.</p>
